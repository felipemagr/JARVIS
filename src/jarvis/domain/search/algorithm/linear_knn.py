class LinearKNN:
    """
    Pure scoring class â€” computes similarity or distance between two vectors
    using the specified distance metric.

    Notes and limitations:
        - This implementation is the perfect representation of brute force. This is not
        efficient nor scalable in ANY way. Thankfully I am implementing this as a proof
        of my coding abilities and not as a real-life solution... Long live LangChain !!!
        - This is not a KNN algorithm in the traditional sense, as it does not involve 
        finding the k-nearest neighbors (this is done in VectorStore, following a similar
        approach as the OpenSearch native client). Instead, it simply computes the distance 
        or similarity score between two vectors.
